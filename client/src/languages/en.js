        "In 2019 I traveled to Berlin to participate in Urban Remedy, a training program on public gardening. I arrived very prepared and got maximum knowledge from all the people who had experience and love for this work. When I returned to Georgia, I decided to design a community garden. ",
        "I always wanted to study something that would add wings to my dreams. But, post my completion of PUC 2nd, though I had enrolled into BE Aeronautical Engineering, my parents got me married in between her course. This clipped my dreams of studying further. ",
        "Post training, I could understand the concept of running a business. I now write the accounts and I have mastered the book- keeping skills for my business. Apart from my business, through Buzz India, I now know the differences between ‘wants’ and ‘needs’. The income and expenses of the house has been balanced by changing certain spending habits. By cutting down unnecessary expenses."
