        "We have a build our ML model on 10000 different water samples, and it gives 80% accuracy. Our testing accuracy is about 82%.",
        "We have installed our instrument at water taps, so user can scan a QR code and get information about PH, turbidity, visibity, drickablity and many more..",
        "When user scan a QR code, then our instrument send a realtime data to our ML model, Where data gets analyze by the model and according that result is shown on the screen.",
        "On the screen, user gets water's attribute, location, last time checks and many more.."

        "In 2019 I traveled to Berlin to participate in Urban Remedy, a training program on public gardening. I arrived very prepared and got maximum knowledge from all the people who had experience and love for this work. When I returned to Georgia, I decided to design a community garden. ",
        "I always wanted to study something that would add wings to my dreams. But, post my completion of PUC 2nd, though I had enrolled into BE Aeronautical Engineering, my parents got me married in between her course. This clipped my dreams of studying further. ",
        "Post training, I could understand the concept of running a business. I now write the accounts and I have mastered the book- keeping skills for my business. Apart from my business, through Buzz India, I now know the differences between ‘wants’ and ‘needs’. The income and expenses of the house has been balanced by changing certain spending habits. By cutting down unnecessary expenses."

        "When user scan the QR code, then our ML model analyze the water sample and it's show the results according to water sample.",
        "Sorry, this instrument is not available in market yet, But we are working on it.",
        "This is useful at many places, such as public water taps, school, offices etc to check water is drinkable or not."
